Crime Prediction System with Python and ANN
This repository contains the code for a Crime Prediction System developed using Python and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The system forecasts the severity of various crime types based on historical crime data and location-specific factors.

Key Features:
Crime Prediction Model: Trained an ANN on historical crime data to predict crime severity and identify high-risk areas.

Web Interface: Developed a user-friendly web interface using Flask that allows users to select a region and instantly view predicted crime insights.

Interactive Maps: Integrated interactive maps using Folium to visualize high-risk areas and display predicted crimes along with safety recommendations.

Scalable and Adaptable: Designed for scalability, the system is adaptable to different datasets and can be used for real-world crime analysis and public safety awareness.

Technologies Used:
Python

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

Flask (for web interface)

Folium (for interactive maps)

JavaScript (for UI enhancements)
